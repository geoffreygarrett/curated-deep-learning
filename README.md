# ``curated-deep-learning``
My personal list of curated deep learning resources from my knowledge bank. 
Please note that this is not, and will probably never be, the most extensive coverage 
of deep learning resources. If you're looking for something along those lines, please 
see [ChristosChristofidis](https://github.com/ChristosChristofidis/awesome-deep-learning)'s
list, it is impressive to say the least.

## Books 📚
- [Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Yoshua Bengio, Ian Goodfellow and Aaron Courville (Latest 2016)

## Introducing key concepts 🗝️
- [Understanding LSTM Networks](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) by [Christopher Olah](https://colah.github.io/about.html) (August 27, 2015)

## Noteworthy websites 🌐
- [Distill](https://distill.pub), a modern medium for presenting research.

## Lectures worth watching 📺
